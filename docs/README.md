# DEEP (Decentralised Ecological Economics Protocol)

## What Is DEEP

DEEP is a protocol that brings eco-data to digital creatives. We collaborate with ecological stewards, such as conservation organisations and rewilding projects, who already generate data as part of their daily work.

Eco-data spans species-specific insights obtained through direct observations, evidence of speciesâ€™ presence (e.g., droppings, tracks) and GPS-tracking devices, as well as broader habitat or ecosystem data collected via top-down remote sensing technologies such as satellites or ground collection of soil and plant samples.

We process this data and make it accessible to digital creatives through our protocol, moving it through cleaning, standardisation and aggregation data pipelines.

Digital creatives utilise this data in their projects, which can range from gaming and virtual environments to music production. The digital representations created using this data are then made available for purchase, with a share of the proceeds (50-70%) going to the conservation organisations directly, and a share to Sovereign Nature Initiative to fund its continued operation.

## DEEP Concepts

Most of the protocol concepts are explained in a separate [protocol section](deep-protocol.md).
