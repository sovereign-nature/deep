# All about value(s)

## Value at the heart of the conversation

Financial independence of the ecological world is the main aspect of our work. We profoundly believe that the key to sustainable life on Earth lies in a revaluation of ecological efforts. The dominant paradigm for funding ecological work revolves around donations, philanthropy and public funding. The key characteristic is thus a dependence on the willingness of other actors to support ecological efforts. As such they sit at the bottom of the priority list, they depend on good will.

We counteract this paradigm by developing new ways of valuing the work of ecological stewards, moving the appreciation from 'nice to have’ toward ‘essential necessity'. The key to this shift lies in integrating the eco-data the steward produce into products of the digital economy thereby making it indispensable. This differs from conventional approaches, usually in the realm of what has come to be known as eco-system services. In our proposition, the value derives from the utility of the data that is produced by doing ecological work. It is thus independent from typical valuations of nature as natural capital in service of human life. The commodification is located at the level of data production and data utility, leaving the integrity of ecological ground work intact.

Our valuation practices are not aimed at putting a price tag on nature, or assess the value of its eco-systemic services. We are building a new economy in the digital world that leaves enough on-site space for ecological stewards to continue doing their work, not having to succumb to the pressures of the market while stepping into the digital economy.

## Digital life not digital twinning

Our pipeline connects eco-data to the digital creative space, where individuals and communities create representations and assets, so-called eco-derivatives. By utilising our protocol, these digital creatives can access and incorporate eco-data provided by ecological stewards into their projects. We do not impose a specific aesthetic or representation of nature in the digital world, but rather empower digital creatives to collaborate, innovate, and showcase their unique perspectives. We embrace the idea that there must be multiple valid representations of eco-data, multiplying the impact and possibilities for ecological work.

## Sovereign Nature as co-existance

Sovereign Nature Initiative owes an inspirational debt to Terra0 and the proposition of self-owning and self-governing forests and thus autonomous non-human agency. Exploring avenues for acknowledging non-human agency is inscribed into the core of our mission. Yet, we emphasise the role of the foundational existing embeddedness of humans within nature, within ecosystems. We are also deliberately seeking collaborations with organisations that work with a holistic approach, including the role that human communities play for interspecies co-existance. Our work taught us that the separation of humans from nature is artificial and not experienced or lived as such by our partners. The amalgam of the daily work in the field, the data produced about it, as well as the formal modes of representation in the legal organisational structure are part of the same organism. The fantasy of unmediated support for an animal or a plant absurdly reduces this complexity and is counter-intuitive when taking the work of eco-stewards seriously.

It is precisely the respect for the complexity of this layering that makes our works stand out. In a time when the pressure for ever more, ever more accurate and ever less mediated eco-data is accelerated by technological invention, the most important work is to hold space for the thick entangled fabric of live where technology is in service of facilitating conviviality.

We do our part which is neither a silver bullet, nor a final destination. But its the important next step that enables a larger socio-ecological transformation.
