# Sovereign Nature Identifier

## Description

**Sovereign Nature Identifier** is a core building block not only for creating nature connected financial products, but also a tool for biodiversity research, incentivized nature data collection, artistic nature representation and others. We want to keep Sovereign Nature Identifier standard simple and version it updates. We can also start thinking about the protocol or ERC20 like token that will allow creation of Sovereign Nature Identifiers derivatives while supporting further development of the Sovereign Nature Identifier tokens. The ecosystem for the Sovereign Nature Identifier can be created using treasury like grants. The voting for grants can be also controlled by the protocol coin staking which will allow us to meet our KPI earlier without putting too many things into hard code.
