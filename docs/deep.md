# Decentralized Ecological Economics Protocol (DEEP)

DEEP is a protocol that brings eco-data to digital creatives. We collaborate with ecological stewards, such as conservation organisations and rewilding projects, who already generate data as part of their daily work. Eco-data spans species-specific insights obtained through direct observations, evidence of species’ presence (e.g., droppings, tracks) and GPS-tracking devices, as well as broader habitat or ecosystem data collected via top-down remote sensing technologies such as satellites or ground collection of soil and plant samples. We process this data and make it accessible to digital creatives through our protocol; cleaning, standardising and aggregating it. Digital creatives utilise this data in their projects, which can range from gaming and virtual environments to art and music production. The digital representations created using this data, so called eco-linked derivatives, are then made available for purchase and the proceeds are shared between the conservation organisations (50-70%) and Sovereign Nature Initiative for funding its continued operations.

## What Is Eco-Data

Eco-data is data produced through the work of ecological stewards in their daily activities in order to inform their conservation and/or restoration strategies and actions internally, and to report on their nature-positive impact.

As it is impossible to measure ecology in all its complexity, we work with the particular data our partners deem important for their work. There are nurmerous organisations involved in the process of collecting, storing, and processing information about ecology while doing their conservation and regeneration activities. We process the data from such activities and make it available to digital creatives throught DEEP and REAL.

The eco-data we proceess needs to be relevant, educational, and rich in empathy.

## Eco-Linked Derivatives

Physical or digital goods can be linked to the eco-data through the DEEP link - a smart contract that stores the link between the eco-data and the linked digital asset, creating an eco-linked derivative.

Creating such eco-linked derivatives is the key for genearting substantial funding streams while imbuing the linked goods with tangible meaning.

## DEEP Link

DEEP Link is an [ERC721](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) token that stores the connection between the linked asset and ecological data set referencing an entiy like an animal or a particular geographical area, enabling the creation of the eco-derivative. It can link any ecological data set to a prodocut - like nature-inspired in-game items, artworks, event tickets, etc. Such eco-linked derivatives can gain new properties, functions, and representations based on the ecology they are connected to.

DEEP Link has the following parameters:
`id` - unique DEEP Link ID which is a product of caching the address of the linked asset into a big integer number.
`entity_id` - ID of the ecological entity according to the protocol.
`steward_id` - ID of the conservation organisation according to the protocol.
`funds_raised` - amount of funds raised by the link for the steward and ecological entity.

## Derivative DID Address System

DEEP uses an address system based on the derivative DID [specification](https://github.com/KILTprotocol/spec-asset-did). The linked derivative address is encoded into the DEEP link token ID via the keccak256 function.

## Rarity Index

Organisation according to rarity is a key logic in the gaming world as well as in the NFT art and gaming spaces. The Rarity Index is a custom metric designed to quantify and communicate the uniqueness and importance of various ecological features captured in the Eco-Data provided by conservation organisations. This index is key for integrating eco-data into gaming as it responds to the request of assigning rarity to items and functionalities by connecting it to real scientific data.  The rarity attributes can be updated from real-life events so that the index evolves together with the linked eco-data.
