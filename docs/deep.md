# Decentralized Ecological Economics Protocol (DEEP)

## DEEP Mission

At Sovereign Nature Initiative, our goal is to refigure the economics of ecology by finding ways to fund and expand projects that sustain life on our planet. Currently, most ecological stewarding projects are severely underfunded. Environmental justice activism and ecological work primarily rely on donations and funding from philanthropies, public institutions, and other donors. This lack of a sustainable financial stream undermines the validation and recognition of the invaluable work being done by ecological stewards such as conservation NGOs, governmental agencies, local communities, and citizen-led initiatives.

To address this issue, we developed the Decentralised Ecological Economics Protocol (DEEP) together with the Registry for Ecological Asset Linking (REAL). Starting from the notion of eco-data and the way it currently shapes and is being shaped by increased demands of verification for biodiversity impact reporting and evaluation, our approach facilitates the flow of value between ecological work and digital creativity, enabling sustainable validation of ecological efforts. By effectively integrating ecological work with the digital realm through processing eco-data, we not only generate value but also give digital assets tangible and real-life significance. Critically, our approach allows ecological stewards to market their work without impeding their on-site efforts, ensuring a harmonious balance between financial viability and ecological preservation.

## What Is Eco-Data

Eco-Data - is data collected through the work of ecological stewards.

It's almost impossible to measure ecology in all its complexity. However, there are thousands of organisations involved in the process of collecting, storing, and processing information about ecology while doing their conservation and regeneration activities. We collect data from such activities and make it available inside of the DEEP.

The Eco-Data requirements are that it needs to be relevant, educational, and rich in empathy, it needs to be collected by the Ecological Steward and shall refer to the Ecological Entity the Project Supported is intended to conserve and/or restore. The Eco-Data is utilized both internally to inform their conservation and/or restoration strategies and actions, and externally to report on their nature-positive impact.

## Eco-Linked Asset

Physical or digital goods can be linked to the Eco-Data through the DEEP Link - a smart contract that stores the link between the Eco-Data and the linked asset.

## DEEP Link

DEEP Link is an [ERC721](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) token that stores the connection between the linked asset and ecological entity. It can link any ecological entity with its derivatives - like nature-inspired in-game items or artworks. Such nature-connected items can get new properties, functions, and representations based on the ecology they are connected to.

### Asset DID Address System

DEEP uses an address system based on the Asset DID standard. The linked asset address is encoded into the DEEP Link token ID via the keccak256 function.

## Rarity Index

Organisation according to a rarity is a key logic in the gaming world as well as in the NFT art and gaming spaces. The Rarity Index is a custom metric designed to quantify and communicate the uniqueness and importance of various ecological features captured in the Eco-Data provided by conservation organisations. This index is key for integrating eco-data into gaming as it responds to the request of assigning rarity to items and functionalities by connecting it to real scientific data.  The rarity attributes can be updated from real-life events so that the index evolves together with the linked eco-data.
