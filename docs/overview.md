#Overview

At Sovereign Nature Initiative, our goal is to reconfigure the economics of ecology by finding ways to fund and expand projects that sustain life on our planet. Currently, most ecological stewarding projects are severely underfunded. Biodiversity restoration primarily relies on donations, funding from philanthropists, public institutions and other donors. The lack of a sustainable financial streams is estimated at approximately $700 billion per year according to the Convention on Biological Diversity Secretariat. Private voluntary contributions toward nature-positive efforts, also knows as “private investments in nature”, play a key role in addressing this funding gap. 

We developed the Decentralised Ecological Economics Protocol (DEEP) together with the Registry for Ecological Asset Linking (REAL) to ensure that private voluntary giving is valuable, and eventually a key mode for contributing to restoration of biodiversity worldwide. Our protocol and interface allow us to effectively integrate data about ecological impact with the digital realm. This approach generates new funding streams while imbuing digital assets with tangible and real-life significance. Critically, our approach allows ecological stewards to market their work without impeding their on-site efforts, ensuring a harmonious balance between financial viability and biodiversity restoration. 

Our work is guided by the following key propositions: 

- breaking with the paradigm of donation: the value of biodiversity is integrated into digital products increasing their value in the digital economy by imbuing them with meaning in the age of digital overproduction;
- verifiying impact through data: minimal access to the most relevant ecological field data used by organisations to monitor their progress and evaluate impact, with a digestible explanation of how the data is used to inform nature-positive strategies and actions;
- selecting trustworthy partners: investing in projects of ecological stewards with a long and successful track record that operate on the ground and are guided by a holistic vision of sustaining live on earth for all species;
- reducing the distance: developing meaningful and long-term connections between contributors and biodiversity practicioners lays the foundation for a large-scale socio-econmic transformation;
