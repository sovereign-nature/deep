# Proof of Concepts (PoCs)

## Sub0/AIMM

**Source of contribution:** Parity Technologies

**Funds raised:** 15.000€

**Eco-linked asset holders:** 3000

AIMM, an ecological steward focused on the conservation of marine wildlife of Portugal's South Coast, is going to allocate the 15.000€ raised to further extend the operations of their ongoing Marine Research and Improvement of Tourism Activities Project. This Supported Project entails conducting 150 scientific boat surveys and hosting 15 workshops, talks, and webinars, with a completion target by the end of 2024. The Project's Objective is twofold: to publish a scientific paper on cetacean biology and ecology, and to partner with five whale watching companies in order to better monitor their compliance with existing regulations. AIMM's commitment to marine conservation and research, established in 2010, underscores its efforts to mitigate human disturbances like tourism and fishing, enhancing the understanding and protection of marine life, including bottlenose dolphins and minke whales.

## Moonsama/KWT

**Funds raised:** 100.000€

**Eco-linked asset holders:** 400

Founded in 2007, the Kenya Wildlife Trust (KWT) is committed to ensuring the long-term viability of predator populations in Kenya through data-driven research and community-supported conservation initiatives. The KWT's main goal is to preserve the ecological integrity of the Greater Mara ecosystems through the conservation of predators in the region, with a main focus on lion, cheetah and wild dogs population. Central to their work is the Mara Predator Conservation Programme, particularly its Lion Research and Conservation Project that the fund raised are supporting. This project's main objective is to conduct constant predator monitoring, including a dedicated three-month intensive period, and to address at least 75% of reported human-wildlife conflict cases by end of 2024.

## FPF/Hotel Hideaway

**Funds raised:** on-going

**Eco-linked asset holders:** 148.000

The Forgotten Parks Foundation (FPF), a non-profit organization committed to safeguarding national parks and biodiversity worldwide, focuses on the fauna, flora, and human communities within Upemba National Park and its surrounding zones. Facing challenges like poaching and habitat loss, their main goal is to protect and value national parks and ecosystems. The Ecological Contribution raised is allocated to support FPF’s Infrastructure and Security Development Project at Upemba National Park. Working with local partners and communities, this Supported Project aims to reach its Objective of monitoring 90% of the park and its buffer zones by 2030, a significant step needed to conserve and restore the Upemba’s diverse wildlife populations, ensuring the resilience of the habitats and the ecosystems they depend on.

## WalletConnect/Aquasearch

**Source of contribution:** WalletConnect

**Funds raised:** 14,500€

**Eco-linked asset holders:** 100.000

Aquasearch, an organisation with expertise in environmental and oceanographic research, focuses on marine wildlife in the Caribbean. Confronting threats like human disturbances from tourist or commercial vessels, their primary goal is to protect and study marine life, particularly cetaceans. They are currently supporting a project to characterise cetacean populations in the Agoa sanctuary that aims to monitor cetacean migrations between Caribbean islands and conduct acoustic characterisation studies to understand their behaviour and reactions to anthropogenic disturbances. By the first quarter of 2025, they intend to influence regulations and policies governing commercial vessel approaches to cetaceans in the Agoa sanctuary. Leveraging bioacoustic research to non-invasively monitor and develop effective conservation strategies for these species the meeting of this objective will be measured by the amendments to applicable legislations.
