# Registry for Ecological Asset Linking (REAL)

## Overview

The Registry for Ecological Asset Linking is the community interface and registry hosting all eco-linked derivatives issued and representing their ecological contribution. Each eco-linked derivative in REAL showcases the information on the relevant eco-data and the contribution toward the supported project. Utilising dAPP functionalities, REAL is geared toward democratising public access, participation and verification processes conducive to the effective and transparent allocation of monetary contributions towards nature-positive endeavours. Each eco-linked derivative hosted on REAL integrates comprehensive qualitative and quantitative data about a supported project, the ecological stewards running it and its Oojective and metrics used to track progress.

## Ecological Impact Methodology

To structure the type of information and reporting needed to track the impact of ecological contributions, Sovereign Nature Initiative developed its own methodology for impact reporting, measurement and verification. The methodology informing the metrics expressed in REAL is an adaptation of globally applied best practices for international conservation project management, while innovating on modes and mechanism for expressing nature-positive impacts and engaging directly with eco-linked derivative holders. By introducing legible and interactive data matrix, REAL enables the transparent tracing of each contribution. In staying close to the field work of the organisations, REAL allows technological steward to dynamically express their achievements.

With REAL SNI aims to enhance trust and commitment between funders and stewards of biodiverse ecosystems, highlighting the potential of alternative funding sources and public involvement in supporting the ambitious targets the world has set to support significant conservation and restoration efforts globally.
