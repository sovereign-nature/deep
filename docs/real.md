# Registry for Ecological Asset Linking (REAL)

## Overview

The Registry for Ecological Asset Linking is the community interface and registry hosting all eco-linked assets and represents their ecological contribution. Each eco-linked asset in REAL showcases information about the relevant eco-data and the contribution toward the supported project. Utilising dAPP functionalities, REAL is geared toward democratising public access, participation and verification processes conducive to the effective and transparent allocation of monetary contributions towards biodiversity restoration. Each eco-linked asset hosted on REAL integrates comprehensive qualitative and quantitative data about a supported project, the biodiversity stewards running it and its objective and metrics used to track progress.

## Ecological Impact Methodology

To structure the type of information and reporting needed to track the impact of biodiversity contributions, Sovereign Nature Initiative developed its own methodology for impact reporting, measurement and verification. The methodology informing the metrics expressed in REAL is an adaptation of globally applied best practices for international conservation project management, while innovating on modes and mechanisms for expressing biodiversity impacts and engaging directly with eco-linked asset holders. By introducing a legible and interactive data matrix, REAL enables the transparent tracing of each contribution. In staying close to the field work of the organisations, REAL allows biodiversity stewards to dynamically express their achievements.

With REAL, SNI aims to enhance trust and commitment between funders and stewards of biodiverse ecosystems, highlighting the potential of alternative funding sources and private involvement in supporting the ambitious targets the world has set to support significant biodiversity conservation and restoration efforts globally.
