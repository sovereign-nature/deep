The 'Signals' category comprises of multiple prints of 5 unique designs, all inspired by the “clicking” sounds produced by sperm whales when approaching the water's surface. Sperm whales use clicks and codas as sophisticated tools of communication and echolocation. Studying such sounds provides important insights into their complex social structures and unique individual identities within pods and helps understand the impact of human activities on their conservation. This edition will have multiple mints available during the campaign period of availability. Minting will close upon the campaign’s end.",
